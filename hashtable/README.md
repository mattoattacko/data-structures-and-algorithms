<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following capabilities

* A method/function named add that takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key and add the key and value pair to the table.
* A method/function named Find that takes in the key and returns the value from key/value pair.
* A method/function named contains that takes in the key and returns if the key exists in the table already.
* A method/function named GetHash that takes in a key and returns the index in the array the key is stored.
