# Binary Search
Binary Search in a sorted 1D array.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
We made our function w/ the sorted array and search key, then set our minimum and maximum values to use. Binary search was used to iterate through the array, and a while loop was used to find the middle index position and current number. We let it run while the minimum was less than or equal to the maximum. Once no match was found, we returned -1.

I've tried multiple times to fix the picture displaying the wrong way, but I give up. It always inserts sideways, no matter what I do.
