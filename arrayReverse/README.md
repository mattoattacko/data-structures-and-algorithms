## Code Challenge 1: Reverse an Array

## Challenge
* Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
* We knew we needed to take in an array of #'s and output that same array in a reverse format. We did this by first making an array, then function. Next we iterated through the array and pushed the values that we got in the index in to a new array. Our solution came by way of multiple trial and error testing in codesandbox.io

## Solution
