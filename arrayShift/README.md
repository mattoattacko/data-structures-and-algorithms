# Insert and shift middle index of array
Code Challenge 2: Array Shift

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
First we wrote a function that took in our array, then used (arr.length / 2) to find the midpoint of our array. We let a for loop run through and insert before we returned the updated array.
