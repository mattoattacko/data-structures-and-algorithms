# Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
* You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Approach & Efficiency
We used 3 different methods to insert values into our Linked Lists, while using a while loop to iterate through and get our current.next, twice. This was difficult and I needed to get help to finish it.
